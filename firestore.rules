/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model combined with
 * role-based access control (RBAC) for a single, hardcoded administrator. The default
 * security posture is "deny-all," where access is only granted through explicit rules.
 *
 * Data Structure: All private user data, including their profile, is nested under a
 * top-level `/users/{userId}` collection. This enforces a clear data boundary for
 * each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Users can only access documents within their own data tree
 *   (i.e., paths starting with `/users/{their_auth_uid}`).
 * - No User Listing: To protect user privacy, it is impossible for any client to
 *   list all documents in the top-level `/users` collection.
 * - Hardcoded Admin: Administrator status is determined by matching the requestor's UID
 *   against a hardcoded admin UID. This is a simple and secure method for a single-admin setup.
 * - Self-Creation: Users are permitted to create their own initial user document,
 *   which is essential for a sign-up flow.
