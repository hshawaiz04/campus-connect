/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model combined with
 * role-based access control (RBAC) for administrators. The default security posture
 * is "deny-all," where access is only granted through explicit rules.
 *
 * Data Structure: All private user data, including their profile, is nested under a
 * top-level `/users/{userId}` collection. This enforces a clear data boundary for
 * each user. Administrative roles are managed in a separate, client-inaccessible
 * `/roles_admin` collection, which is used by the rules engine for authorization checks.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Users can only access documents within their own data tree
 *   (i.e., paths starting with `/users/{their_auth_uid}`).
 * - No User Listing: To protect user privacy, it is impossible for any client to
 *   list all documents in the top-level `/users` collection.
 * - Database-Centric Roles: Administrator status is determined by the existence of a
 *   document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` path. This avoids using custom claims,
 *   making role management auditable directly within the database. This collection is
 *   not readable or writable by any client to prevent enumeration of admins.
 * - Self-Creation: Users are permitted to create their own initial user document,
 *   which is essential for a sign-up flow.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The rules rely on path-based security, where the
 * `{userId}` wildcard in the path is the primary source of truth for ownership. This
 * avoids slow and costly `get()` calls to parent documents. The `roles_admin`
 * collection is a form of denormalization; its sole purpose is to provide a fast,
 * secure lookup for the `isAdmin()` authorization check.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Private user data (`/users/{userId}/...`) is structurally
 * segregated from the admin role data (`/roles_admin`). This clear separation allows for
 * simple, highly secure rules for each collection without the risk of data leakage.
